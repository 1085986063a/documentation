::: warning Attention
<span style="color:orange; font-size:1em; font-weight: bold" >I have already tried the new app, so far everything works fine. <br>
Only the MQTT connection to ioBroker MQTT Broker/Client doesn't work for me. When everything set, the app crashes the app immediately crashes when connecting and then restarts and
then crashes again, you can only interrupt this, wen one the MQTT adapter off.
<br>
<br>
Whether this is due to the MQTT adapter or the app I cannot say unfortunately because I am not familiar with the MQTT thing.
If you are using the new app, and you have the same problem, then create an issue at the [MQTT Adapter](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.mqtt) or at the
[TheTimeWalker Wallpanel App](https://github.com/TheTimeWalker/wallpanel-android) </span>
:::

:::tip Info
So if you want to try the new app, you can download from GitHub the APK and install it on your tablet. <br>
Otherwise, you can continue to use the app from the Google Play Store, but then you will not get updates for the app.
