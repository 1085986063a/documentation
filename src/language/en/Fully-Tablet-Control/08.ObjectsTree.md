* at the created data points you can adjust the brightness manually for this you have to change first at point **1** from Admin to User,
  then you can change the brightness manually at point **3**.

* at point **2** a **true** value is set for a warning when the tablet is not charging.

* at point **4** the current battery level is written for a vis display e.g. **[ basic-Image 8 Widget]**.
  during normal operation, only the % number is written e.g. **10 %** when the tablet is charging, **charge 10 %** is displayed.

```
0 = 0%
1 = 10%
2 = charge 10%
3 = 20%
4 = charge 20%
5 = 30%
6 = charge 30%
7 = 40%
8 = charge 40%
9 = 50%
10 = charge 50%
11 = 60%
12 = charge 60%
13 = 70%
14 = charge 70%
15 = 80%
16 = charge 80%
17 = 90%
18 = charge 90%
